   - Multi-layer storage: DynamoDB (metadata), OpenSearch (vectors), Neo4j (graphs)
   - RESTful and MCP protocol APIs
   - Sophisticated memory processing with embeddings and relationships

2. **Memory Dashboard** (Next.js 15 Frontend)
   - Real-time memory browsing with infinite scroll
   - Interactive knowledge graph visualization
   - Agent management and monitoring
   - Administrative controls and health monitoring
