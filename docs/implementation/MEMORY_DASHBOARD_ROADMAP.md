## Phase 5: Project Management & Collaboration (Week 9-10)

### Project-Based Memory Isolation
- [ ] Implement project selection and switching
- [ ] Add project-specific memory filtering
- [ ] Create cross-project search capabilities
- [ ] Add project memory statistics and comparisons

### Memory Management
- [ ] Implement bulk memory operations (tag, delete, export)
- [ ] Add memory import/export functionality
- [ ] Create memory backup and restore features
- [ ] Add memory archival and lifecycle management

### Collaboration Features
- [ ] Add memory commenting and annotation system
- [ ] Implement memory sharing and permissions
- [ ] Create audit log and version history
- [ ] Add collaborative memory editing

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive component renders
- Implement virtual scrolling for large memory lists
- Use Web Workers for graph layout calculations
- Add service worker for offline capabilities

### State Management Strategy
```typescript
// Zustand stores structure
interface MemoryStore {
  memories: Memory[]
  filters: MemoryFilters
  selectedMemory: Memory | null
  loading: boolean
  pagination: PaginationState
}

interface GraphStore {
  nodes: GraphNode[]
  edges: GraphEdge[]
  selectedNodes: string[]
  layout: GraphLayout
  filters: GraphFilters
}

interface UIStore {
  theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system'
  sidebarCollapsed: boolean
  activeView: 'browser' | 'graph' | 'analytics' | 'agents'
}
```

### API Integration Pattern
```typescript
// TanStack Query setup
const useMemories = (filters: MemoryFilters) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['memories', filters],
    queryFn: () => memoryApi.getMemories(filters),
    staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, // 5 minutes
    refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
  })
}

// Real-time updates
const useMemoryUpdates = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient()
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3001/memory/ws')
    
    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const update = JSON.parse(event.data)
      if (update.type === 'memory_created') {
        queryClient.invalidateQueries(['memories'])
      }
    }
    
    return () => ws.close()
  }, [queryClient])
}
```
